# /update-config-or-workflow-file

Use this workflow when working on **update-config-or-workflow-file** in `first-contributions-ja.github.io`.

## Goal

Updates to configuration or workflow files, such as tsconfig or GitHub Actions workflow YAMLs.

## Common Files

- `tsconfig.json`
- `tsconfig.test.json`
- `.github/workflows/jaipilot-generate.yml`

## Suggested Sequence

1. Understand the current state and failure mode before editing.
2. Make the smallest coherent change that satisfies the workflow goal.
3. Run the most relevant verification for touched files.
4. Summarize what changed and what still needs review.

## Typical Commit Signals

- Edit the relevant config or workflow file (e.g., tsconfig.json, tsconfig.test.json, .github/workflows/jaipilot-generate.yml)
- Commit the change, often with [skip ci] in the message

## Notes

- Treat this as a scaffold, not a hard-coded script.
- Update the command if the workflow evolves materially.
